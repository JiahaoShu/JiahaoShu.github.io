          <p>
            I'm a fourth-year undergraduate studying Computer Science at USTC. 
            I completed a visiting semester at UC Berkeley during spring 2025 and am preparing for graduate school applications.

          <p>
            My research interests include <strong>applied machine learning</strong>, <strong>causal inference</strong>, 
            and <strong>robust AI systems</strong>. I'm particularly interested in understanding how models 
            behave in real-world conditions and building systems that work reliably beyond their training environments.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            I've had opportunities to work on research in computer vision and machine learning. 
            Recently, I'm working on controllable trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles at HKUST (Guangzhou), 
            advised by Prof. Zhiqing Hong. Previously, I've explored topics ranging from evaluating vision-language 
            models at Berkeley, to studying user preferences for AI-generated content, to developing weather-aware 
            image restoration systems.

          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance running. I've completed several 10K campus races 
            and marathons. Running helps me think through research problems and maintain balance.
